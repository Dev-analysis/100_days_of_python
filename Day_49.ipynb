    "Before we can perform any operations on a file, we must first open it. Python provides the open() function to open a file. It takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode can be **'r'** for reading, **'w'** for writing, or **'a'** for appending. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are various modes in which we can open files. \n",
    "1. **read(r)**: This mode opens the file for reading only and gives an error if the file does not exist. This is the default mode if no mode is passed as a parameter.\n",
    "2. **write(w)**: This mode opens the file for writing only and creates a new file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "3. **append(a)**: This mode opens the file for appending only and creates a new file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "4. **create(x)**: This mode creates a file and gives an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "5. **text(t)**: Apart from these modes we also need to specify how the file must be handled. t mode is used to handle text files. t refers to the text mode. there is no difference between r and rt or w and wt since text mode is the default. The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, a synonym of 'rt').\n",
