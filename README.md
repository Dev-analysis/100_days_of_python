# 100 Days of Python Project

## Introduction: 
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python project repository! This project is a personal journey where I am dedicating myself to learn Python from beginner to advanced levels. Although I have a basic understanding of Python, this project will help me deepen my knowledge and explore more advanced concepts.

 

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to improve my Python programming skills through consistent practice and learning. By committing to the 100 days challenge, I aim to become proficient in Python programming and explore various libraries, frameworks, and applications of Python in real-world scenarios.


## Tracking Progress
I will be using GitHub to track my progress throughout the 100 days. Each day's work will be documented and committed to this repository, allowing me to review my progress over time and showcase my journey to others.

## Tools and Technologies
1. IDE: Initially, I will be using Jupyter Notebook for coding as it provides an interactive environment for Python development. However, as I progress, I may explore other IDEs and text editors based on specific project requirements and recommendations.
2. GitHub: I will use GitHub to manage and share my codebase, track progress, and collaborate with others.
3. Additional Software: As I advance in my learning journey, I may explore and incorporate other software tools and libraries to enhance my coding skills and projects.

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by the Indian tech YouTuber, Code_with_harry. His dedication to teaching and passion for programming have motivated me to embark on this journey of self-improvement and learning. I am grateful for his guidance and will apply the principles and techniques learned from his tutorials in my own code.
